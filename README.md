# BerPlayer
BerPlayer is an Android App where the main purpose is to read all songs on the user's device and play them using Android MediaPlayer. With the app, you can listen to the songs, rewind, fast forward, pause, and even repeat the song as many times as you want. With a simple design and extremely easy to use, this is my latest project.
